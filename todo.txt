Only think about spacing.
Do not worry about python language.
Think of only about programming languages.
Check after a newline character
a boolean value to check whether a newline character was processed and a counter to check whether a curly brace has been opened.
If both of them are satisfied, a new function will return a string of spaces to be added to the file instead of the available number of spaces.
There is one other thing, to replace the existing string, create a string and append to it, the set of spaces. Replace these spaces with the output from the previously mentioned function.

Write the pseudocode first

1. If open bracket and after a newline there are more or less than 4 spaces, change it to 4 spaces.
2. Count the number of open brackets.


1. Maybe I can push to a stack and pop from a stack whenever an open bracket is found
2. Then when the closing bracket is found, just pop the last element
